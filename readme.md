## Javascript algorhitmic challenges #5
fiveth exercise of my 100 chalenges in 30 days!!
* The goal is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is '(' if that character appears only once in the original string, or ')' if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

* Examples
```
"Success" => ")())())"
"(( @" => "))(("

```

	
## How to see the results of my solution?
